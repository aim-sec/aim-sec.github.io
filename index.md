# Welcome
Welcome to aim-sec, an application security blog. I write articles about AppSec vulnerabilities I encouter in my travels, sharing knowledge I think could benefit other cyber security practioners looking at similar problems.   
- **Root causes** -- To assess a potential AppSec issue, you need to understrand the underlying principles
- **Detection** -- Has your scanner identified a vulnerability? Is it real? Was anything missed?
- **Exploitation** -- The fun part,  where the rubber meets the road.
- **Rememdiation** -- Pointing out a problem is much more helpful when you have the solution.
